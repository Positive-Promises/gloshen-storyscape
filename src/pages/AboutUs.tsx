                  At GLOHSEN, we're on a mission to transform healthcare education and professional development. 
                  We believe in creating accessible pathways to healthcare excellence through innovative 
                  technology, comprehensive assessment, and personalized guidance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our goal is to bridge the gap between education and employment in the healthcare sector, 
                  ensuring that professionals can find the right opportunities and employers can 
                  identify the most qualified candidates.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  GLOHSEN was founded by a team of healthcare professionals and educators who recognized 
                  the challenges facing both healthcare students and industry employers. We observed that 
                  traditional methods of assessment and job placement were not adequately serving either 
                  group, leading to mismatches and inefficiencies.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  In response, we developed the proprietary GLOHSEN Scoreâ€”a comprehensive evaluation system 
                  that accounts for both technical knowledge and essential soft skills. This holistic approach 
                  provides a more accurate representation of a candidate's abilities and potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since our inception, we've grown from a small startup to a comprehensive platform 
                  serving thousands of healthcare professionals, students, educators, and employers 
                  around the world.
